===============

Running adaptive sampling requires some prepared inputs beforehand.

A short-list of necessary files are as follows:

1: Initial structure/topology files for production simulations
2: Structure



Prepare your starting state.

As of now, this package only supports running simulations with GROMACS. Tutorials for using GROMACS and preparing a starting state for a production run can be found [here](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/).
